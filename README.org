#+title: RV's Dotfiles

Hello, There!

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. I keep here all of my dotfiles for various softwares I use. Like [[https://qtile.org/][QTile]], [[https://hyprland.org/][Hyprland]].

Dotfiles are the files, whose name begins with a period(.) and are generally hidden, which are utilised by softwares to keep their configurations.

Feel free to take anything from it, you can use the entire dotfiles as it is but it is recommended for you to go through all the files first
and understand what they do.
