#+title: RV's Dotfiles

Hello, There!
Welcome to my dotfiles repository. I keep here all of my dotfiles for various softwares I use. Like [[https://qtile.org/][QTile]], [[https://hyprland.org/][Hyprland]] for example.
Dotfiles are the files whose name begins with a period(.) and are generally hidden which also are utilised by softwares to keep their configurations.
